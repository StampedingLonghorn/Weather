# Weather
Type in your airport's ICAO code and a list of your airport's weather condistions will output.
This program only works for KAUS for some reason.
TODOs:
1. Add support for more airports. (It will involve creating a new version and changing list arrangements around).
2. Adding temperatures.
3. Fixing weather types.
